# PyBer_Analysis
## Introduction
My project was to create a summary dataframe and graph based on data from a ride sharing company, PyBer, using Pandas and Matplotlib together. The request was looking to show the total weekly fares for each type of city (urban, suburban, and rural) from January to April. This report will be able to show how the data differs between types of cities and be used to make future decisions at PyBer.
## Results

Some important points can be made from this graph:
 - The Urban city type was able to make the most fares compared to the other three.
 - The Suburban city type had the second most fares, making almost double the fares of the Rural city type.
 - Each city had noticeable disparity in their fare amounts, for example Rural city type highest amount of fares at $500 is still less than Suburbanâ€™s lowest amount of fares.

This scatter plot helps to explain the disparity between the city type in the previous graph. The purpose of this graph is to show average fare per number of rides by city type. Note, each circle correlates with a driver and its size with number of drivers.
 - Rural drivers get the fewest riders and charge the highest fares, up to $44 a ride.
 - While Urban city type charges the least per fare it still makes the most from having more drivers than the other two types combined.
 - With Suburban city having the second most drivers, they gets more riders than Rural while at the same time charging more than Urban drivers.
## Summary
After looking at the data and having these results in mind I could give some recommendations. First Rural drivers could lower their fares to bring in more rides. Second, with no shortage of drivers in the Urban city type, those drivers could safely risk raising theirs fares to increase profit. Lastly, I would recommend Suburban drivers also raise their fares to incentivize more drivers to join.
